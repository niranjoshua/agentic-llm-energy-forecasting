This directory contains the modular Python source code that powers the Agentic LLM time-series forecasting framework.

The modules here implement the core components of the system, including:

- Data ingestion and preprocessing pipelines
- Feature engineering and seasonal/trend analysis
- Agent orchestration logic
- TIME-LLM forecasting integration
- Evaluation and benchmarking against classical and deep learning models
- Reporting, explanation, and result generation

This separation from notebooks ensures the project follows research engineering best practices, enabling reproducibility, modularity, and future extension of the framework.
