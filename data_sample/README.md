This folder contains a small anonymised sample of the energy time-series dataset used in this project.

The full dataset (156,890 hourly European electricity records from 2015–2025) is not included due to size and data usage restrictions. 

This sample is provided to:
- Demonstrate the structure and format of the data used
- Allow reproduction of preprocessing and feature engineering steps
- Enable testing of the forecasting pipeline without requiring the full dataset

The data follows the same schema as the original dataset used in the research.
