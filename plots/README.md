This folder contains key visual outputs generated during the project.

The plots demonstrate:
- Time-series characteristics of the energy dataset (seasonality, trends, anomalies)
- Forecasting results from the Agentic LLM framework
- Comparisons against classical and deep learning baselines (ARIMA, ETS, DLinear)
- Evaluation metrics and error analysis
- Interpretability outputs and scenario analysis

These visualisations were generated directly from the Colab notebooks and are included here to provide immediate insight into the system's performance without needing to rerun the full pipeline.
